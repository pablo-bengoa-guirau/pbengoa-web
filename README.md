## 1. Description of the work
*(The goal of this project is to develop a personal academic website to demonstrate HTML and CSS)*

The project follows a structured development process:

1.  **Design Analysis:** First, I selected a visual style based on professional software engineering portfolios (specifically inspired by Brittany Chiang), choosing a minimalist "Dark Mode" aesthetic.
2.  **Environment Setup:** I organized the project using a specific directory structure (`docs/` as the root for deployment), separating styles (`css`), assets (`images`), and content pages (`public`).
3.  **Core Development:** I focused on creating a reusable layout (Header, Navigation, and Footer) to maintain consistency across all pages.
4.  **Content Implementation:** Finally, I developed the specific sections required by the assignment (`About`, `Degree`, `Net`, `Contact`) integrating the content with the defined style.

- Update 1/2: We are putting a basic structure to the website (index.html) to first place the necessary information before starting with the CSS or other subpages. As a second small update to index.html, I've tweaked some classes to give them more specific names. I've also significantly modified the `<main>` section, almost completing it by adding different subsections for better organization, along with some bold text for emphasis. Finally, I've modified the footer with classes to include several sections and give it a more professional look.


## 2. Problems during development

## 3. Conclusions
*(To be filled upon project completion)*

* **Learning Outcomes:** (What did you learn about Git? About structuring HTML? About the Box Model?)
* **Future Improvements:** (If you had more time, what would you add? JS animations? A backend?)

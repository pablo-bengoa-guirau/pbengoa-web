## 1. Description of the work
*(The goal of this project is to develop a personal academic website to demonstrate HTML and CSS)*

The project follows a structured development process:

1.  **Design Analysis:** First, I selected a visual style based on professional software engineering portfolios (specifically inspired by Brittany Chiang), choosing a minimalist "Dark Mode" aesthetic.
2.  **Environment Setup:** I organized the project using a specific directory structure (`docs/` as the root for deployment), separating styles (`css`), assets (`images`), and content pages (`public`).
3.  **Core Development:** I focused on creating a reusable layout (Header, Navigation, and Footer) to maintain consistency across all pages.
4.  **Content Implementation:** Finally, I developed the specific sections required by the assignment (`About`, `Degree`, `Net`, `Contact`) integrating the content with the defined style.

- Update 1: We are putting a basic structure to the website (index.html) to first place the necessary information before starting with the CSS or other subpages.


## 2. Problems during development
*(This section serves as a development log. I will update it as I encounter and solve issues).*

* **Problem:** (Espacio para rellenar cuando lleguemos al CSS del menú...)
* **Solution:** ...

## 3. Conclusions
*(To be filled upon project completion)*

* **Learning Outcomes:** (What did you learn about Git? About structuring HTML? About the Box Model?)
* **Future Improvements:** (If you had more time, what would you add? JS animations? A backend?)
